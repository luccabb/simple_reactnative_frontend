## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then follow the instructions to initialize the mobile, backend, and frontend:

### Mobile

Change Directory to Mobile and Install dependencies

```
$ cd simple_reactnative_frontend
$ yarn
```

If you have an Android or IOS emulator, you'll be ready to run the app locally after adding your backend address as the `baseURL` parameter on the file `simple_reactnative_frontend/src/services/api.js`

**Android**
```
$ yarn android
```

**IOS**
```
$ yarn ios
```

You can also run it in your own phone through Expo, install it with:

```
$ yarn global add expo-cli
```

Then run:

**Android**
```
$ yarn android
```

**IOS**
```

```
